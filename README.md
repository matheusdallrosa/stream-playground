# stream-playground
A repository wherein i store my stream related code.

The code on this repository is very related to the code from:  [xstream](https://github.com/staltz/xstream). Due to the fact that i'm studying that project to know more about how streams work internally.

To-do list:
- Build a test suite using mocha.
- Build a event producer.
